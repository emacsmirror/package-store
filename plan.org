* what?
** a personal archive of packages
** a directory structure
*** in your ~/.emacs.d?
** stores all the packages you download
** in raw form

* why?
** so you can keep a package store around of everything you use
** back it up, for example

* how
** package--with-work-buffer does the download for the package
** that's a macro
** but we have
*** package-download-tar
*** package-download-single
** which both use it
** url-retrieve-synchronously is used to retrieve
** so advise those 2 functions with something that sets
*** url-cache-directory
** to the package cache dir

* retrieval?
** how to know when we are disconnected?
** url-fetch-from-cache can fetch from cache
*** needs to access the args
**** that package-download-tar passes to package--with-work-buffer
** could we flet url-retrieve-synchronously in the advice?
*** that gets the url

* issues
** doesn't work because
*** the package archive is not cached
**** could just try and copy the archive from the elpa near the package-store
**** or could try and cache that as well
**** function package--download-one-archive
***** does the download and needs to be cached
*** url doesn't detect network down
**** we could detect this:
***** url-http (url-http.el) calls
****** url-http-find-free-connection makes the connection
***** and on nil return errors
****** "Could not create connection to host:port"
**** we could advise url-http to catch the error
***** and then try again with the disconnect mode turned on

* other ideas
** this idea from the HN thread
*** http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4278704
*** keep the installed packages as a list in customize
*** then you can install the packages you want just by having access to the customize value
