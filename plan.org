* what?
** a personal archive of packages
** a directory structure
*** in your ~/.emacs.d?
** stores all the packages you download
** in raw form

* why?
** so you can keep a package store around of everything you use
** back it up, for example

* how
** package--with-work-buffer does the download for the package
** that's a macro
** but we have
*** package-download-tar
*** package-download-single
** which both use it
** url-retrieve-synchronously is used to retrieve
** so advise those 2 functions with something that sets
*** url-cache-directory
** to the package cache dir

* retrieval?
** how to know when we are disconnected?
** url-fetch-from-cache can fetch from cache
*** needs to access the args
**** that package-download-tar passes to package--with-work-buffer
** could we flet url-retrieve-synchronously in the advice?
*** that gets the url
